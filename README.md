Hi !

We all had to faced a very special Covid-2019 year, even more people had to stay home and do homeoffice work.
It is therefore very important, to keep our body in a good shape and balanced, especially when doing homeoffice with very limited options to go out and live our lifes as before.

My final project is called: "Workout recorder"

The goal behind this web-app is to keep track of and motivate user to workout regularly, and so stay in good menthal and physical shape.
Since first covid wave began here in Europe in early March 2020, I personally started to do a little workout, and I used to do it so much, that I am doing my thing 3 times a week since then.
Honestlly I feel like a winner as I am not very organised person, but this workout habit is proving that I am capable of being organised, dedicated and regular.

What I missed out when doing my workout, was to have an ability to record my workout progress which I surelly achieved and it is still ongoing process.
Now after finishing CS50, I am capable of writing web-app to help me to record my workout progress.


Please find my "Workout recorder" app funcionality as below:

• register new user
• user login
• choosing from various type of exercises
• show chosen exercise name, animated picture .gof, let user define define number of repetitions and amount of weight lifted
• confirm succesfull exercise set by clicking DONE button
• display user's history, what exercise, amount of weights, number of repetitions was done by a user and when
• user logout


This is it. I know there is a big potential for code and funcionality improvement, but due to my plan to finish until the end of 2020, I am happy with my result.


Thank you to Mr.David MALAN, Dough, David and all other CS50 team members for possibility to have this lifechanging experience and chance to accomplish this excellent online education.

God bless you all !
